# ChatBox Widget for Next.js Apps

Create a ChatBox Widget (like Intercom live chat) for your Next.js app. Nothing to maintain, it is completely serverless. When your website's visitor starts a session, the chat link is sent to your Slack channel.

This is our fork of the original project just so we could control where the chat host resolves.

Plan at some point to make this a proper fork and make that item configurable in settings
